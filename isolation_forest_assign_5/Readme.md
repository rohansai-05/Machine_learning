## project overview
This project detects anomalies in manufacturing process data using Isolation forest algorithm. It involves data preprocessing,model training,evaluation and visualization of results.

## files 

- isolation_forest_assign_5.ipynb : a jupyter notebook containing code for preprocessing,training,evaluation,visualization
- Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing Process Data : pdf summarizing approach,findings,recommendations
- Readme.md : this instruction file

## how to run notebook

1. open 'isolation_forest_assign_5.ipynb' in jupyter notebook
2. run all cells sequentially 

## dependencies
